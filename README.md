# Search Result Keybindings

A customizable way to navigate search result pages: press a key of your choice and highlight the next search result on (American) Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Baidu.

Miss being able to navigate Google with the arrow keys and â–¶ symbol circa 2010? This extension is for you.

## Default commands

Default commands are based on Vim but all keys can be changed to anything on the keyboard.

* `j` to go to the next result
* `k` to go to the preceding result
* `/` to go to the search bar
* `h` to go to the top result
* `m` to go to the middle result
* `l` to go to the last result
